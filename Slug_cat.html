    <h1> Slugcats </h1>
     <p> Slugcats (or scugs as they're commonly called) are long fuzzy bipedal cylindrical creatures standing with half of their body erect and their flat faces pointing ahead with their ears resembling a candle's flame, furthermore, the hind end of their body which lays flat in a standing postion drags along and is of noticeably more rotund form, and even more noticeable are several glands dotting each side of their hind end, accompanied by smaller glands sprinkled along in nonrandom formations differing from one scug to another. <br> They were domisticated with the purpose of pipe cleaning as their bodyplan and fur proved highly effective with minimal modifications, said modifications were plumming them up a bit as to make it a bit more of a tight fit. (it was cost effective too!) </p>
    <h2> Origin </h2>
     <p> As it should be of no surprise, they are descendants of the proto-scug, developing complex social systems and colonies. </p>
