    <h1> Slugcats </h1>
     <p> Slugcats (or scugs as they're commonly called) are long, fuzzy, bipedal, largely cylinderical creatures standing with half of their body erect and their flat faces pointing ahead with their ears shaped like a candle's flame. Furthermore, the hind of their body lays flat when in a standing postion, and is of noticeably more rotund form. Several glands dot each side of their hind end, accompanied by smaller glands sprinkled along in nonrandom formations that differ from one scug to another. <br> They were domisticated with the purpose of pipe cleaning, as their bodyplan and fur proved highly effective, even moreso after they selectively bred them to amplify their diameter to fit the pipes they dwell in <i> completely </i> flush. </p>

     <h2> Habitat and diet </h2>
     <p> They are omnivorous in nature and so eat off of all available sources, hunting and gathering and even taking advantage of scugpollos for their eggs. </p>
