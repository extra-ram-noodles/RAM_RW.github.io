    <h1> Slugcats </h1>
     <p> Slugcats (or scugs as they're commonly called) are long, fuzzy, bipedal, largely cylinderical creatures standing with half of their body erect and their flat faces pointing ahead with their ears shaped like a candle's flame. Furthermore, the hind of their body lays flat when in a standing postion, and is of noticeably more rotund form. Several glands dot each side of their hind end, accompanied by smaller glands sprinkled along in nonrandom formations that differ from one scug to another. <br> They were domisticated with the purpose of pipe cleaning, as their bodyplan and fur proved highly effective, even moreso after they selectively bred them to change their diameter as to fit snugly in the pipes they're assigned to. </p>

     <h2> Origin </h2>
     <p> They're descendants of the proto-scug, highly adaptable to any enviorment and smarter than other slug cat species, making good use of their opposable digits. </p>
     <h2> Habitat and diet </h2>
     <p> They are omnivorous in nature and so eat off of all available sources, hunting and gathering and even taking advantage of <a href="./Slug_cat_pollo.html"> scugpollos </a> for eggs. </p>

     <h1> Behaviour </h1>
     <p> Slugcats are a very intellegent species that take advantage of available resources. They're also complex socially and behave in neatly organized communities known as colonies, though some strains have been shown to prefer living solitarily or in groups directly related by blood. </p>
     <h3> Colony structure </h3>
     <p> In colonies, individuals are seperated into three main roles: Gaffers, henlikes, and colony proles. </p>
     <ul>
      <li> Gaffers take care of keeping the colony's domain safe, redividing labor if short on scugs, and relocating their colony if needed, they also manage food and hunting trips, this role is taken up by multiple older slugcat. </li>
      <li> Henlikes take care of pups, unsurprisingly, they're also the ones responsible of producing eggs and a slime unique to them that's eaten by pups, referred to by vittle. henlikes almost never go outside the colony and thus cannot survive the wilderness alone, their day consists of nurturing pups and making eggs in spring, they have very little else to worry about. </li>
      <li> Colony proles do the most varied work in the entire colony, their duties include: Tending to scugpollos, protecting the colony, hunting and cooking for the colony, tending to others' wounds be it serious or a pup's scraped knee, poking scugpollos with sticks so they stay where they're supposed to be amongst other duties. Though not all work tirelessly as some are simply not assigned roles by the gaffers. </li>
     </ul>
     <h2> Procreation </h2>
     <p> Slugcats breed every season, any henlike scug may breed with a prole if feeling broody, otherwise it skips the season and makes unfertilized eggs, which are eaten as if scugpollo eggs. Proles sometimes bicker over henlikes who might not love them back, but henlikes only show their disinterest after the fact as the petty infighting between proles is an amusing sight for all. </p>
     <h2> Relations with other species </h2>
     <p> Their relation with redomesticated scugpollos is mutualistic, scugs getting food in the form of eggs while scugpollos get food and shelter, a win-win. There also exists their relationship with Scavangers, another intellegent creature of the rain world, they trade and trust eachother under guidlines, any who break the pact are disowned by their kin and made enemiesof the other. </p>
