        <h3> The roadmap: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Describe the planet [done] </li>
            <p> It is a planet of sand, scorching on its substellar side and freezing on its other, its poor absorbtion of heat disallowing it to ever reach an equilibrium on opposing sides, it ranges from 47° directly under the sun to a freezing -141° celsius in the coordinates farthest from the substellar point. <br> In that huge gradient lies a small band hospitable to life, though its constant march does not allow life to start, rather, it begun at one of the polar gyesers and hot lakes connected to massive subterrenean reservoirs, that of which power all rain and snowfall. </p>
            <li> Describe creatures' organs and biochemistery in low detail </li>
            <li> Make the oldest common ancestors of fauna and of flora </li>
            <li> Diversify the proto ecosystem of mobile creatures </li>
            <li> Describe the beginnings of the caravan and its species </li>
            <li> Describe the mass convergent traits and behaviour plus the extreme specializations of some species </li>
        </ul>
