        <h1> The Endless Caravan </h1>
        <hr size="3" noshade>
        <p> In a planet rotating around itself and its relatively close sun, life evolves in a band hostpitable to it that increases and shifts towards the dark regions in summer and the sunny regions in winter. <br> The species there cannot afford to stay still, most of their time is spent walking to the edge of hospitable area. Organisms are split into multiple categories, most notably flora, underground flora, grazing fauna, hunting fauna, and the focus of the project, an array of species in a tight knit web of symbiosis. These multi-species superorganisms named caravans are full of species that seem so specialized in aspects they're dysfunctional without aid, and that's with a reason as in a planet that makes it hard to settle down, innovation is necessary. </p>
        <h3> The roadmap: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Make the oldest common ancestors of fauna and flora </li>
            <li> List the molicular components of fauna and flora, and then describe their organs and biocchemistery in low detail </li>
            <li> Diversify the proto ecosystem of mobile creatures </li>
            <li> Describe the beginnings of the caravan and its species </li>
            <li> Describe the mass convergent traits and behaviour plus the extreme specializations of some species </li>
        </ul>
