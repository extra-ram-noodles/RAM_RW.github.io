The roadmap:
	1. Describe the planet:
		It is a planet of sand, scorching on its ,subsolar side and freezing on its other, its poor absorbtion of heat disallowing it to ever reach an equilibrium on opposing sides, it ranges from 47° directly under the sun to a freezing -141° celsius in the coordinates farthest from the subsolar point. In that huge gradient lies a small band hospitable to life, though its constant march does not allow life to start, rather, it begun at one of the polar gyesers and hot lakes connected to massive subterrenean reservoirs, that of which power all rain and snowfall.
	2. Describe creatures' organs and biochemistery in low detail and Make the oldest common ancestors of fauna and of flora:
	All life (we know of currently) shares these traits that presumebly came from a common ancestor:
		
	All life split to a few kingdoms coming from their respective common ancestors:
		•Duramacie (Kingdom Durimici): Creatures with 5 fingers spread evenly, known for their possession of hard subcutaneous plates that keep them together along with six limbs and four horns, one big one small. The horns themselves are their method of breathing as they intake air and run it through layers upon layers of thin membranes behind the horns, absorbing oxygen in what can be described as sails. they also see through a lot of small scallop-like eyes. Furthermore they're padded with lightwieght fat-like cells, though they're not nearly as calorically dense, and thus were named lesser fat.
		•Aquacaedentes (Kingdom Minimarerum): Blind, deaf, filter feeders with four paddle like legs and many, many barbles, they speed around filtering water efficiently. So efficiently in fact that typically, they don't die of old age or being hunted, rather they die of positive buoyancy caused from high lesser fat percentages. They're held together by one big plate and their thick skin and breath via said skin, which limits their size.
		•Sessilia (Kingdom Sessilin): Most creatures that don't move in adulthood are believed to come from this ancestor, this includes all shrubbery in both the hot and cold climates.
The first fauna to come on land are speculated to be a minimarerum species, followed by duramacitic omnivores, though the minimarerum had a huge headstart.
	2. Diversify the proto ecosystem of mobile creatures:
		Skip a few dingusillion years and you'll find many decendant species, such as:
		•Watervines: Hot desert dwelling largely subterrenean sessilins with above ground shrubbery, possesing hard shelled fruits that use pressure built from the heated water inside to propel seeds impressive distances.
		•Hermit trees: tree like organisms which only grow when the temperate twighlight of the solar cycle when it passes through, otherwise, it regresses into its insulating bark and goes into a period of dormancy until the next solar cycle.
		•Camelskink: An omnivorous Duramici living in the hot desert possessing a two chambered stomach, the first bigger chamber that's in its hump is solely for storage and fermentation of food for later use, be it to feed the individual or to share, meanwhile the second chamber is for digestion of the second chamber's content.
•Uva: Minimarerum species of ovoid creatures that link together to form a moving holobiont, they gnaw at the roots of  watervines and share sustanance by cirulating blood amongst eachother in sessions before sleeping via two way ports on their paddles. They may seem to be in total chaos, however that is not the case, as the manner in which they link seperates the holobionts into two distinct catagories: The outer, moving layer of uvas, while the inner layer comtainimg individuals that only come out when the holobiont is feeding. You could say, the legs and the stomach.
		•Winter Uva: Egregiously fluffly subspecies of Uva that live in the cold desert regions and feast upon hermit tree bark, each individual keeps warm in their method of movement, as an individual goes inside and outside the holobiont periodically as it moves, though some individuals are so deep in the holobiont's core they cannot move at all.
	3. Describe the beginnings of the caravan
	4. Describe the mass convergent traits and behaviour plus the extreme specializations of some species
