The roadmap:
	1. Describe the planet:
		It is a planet of sand, scorching on its subsolar side and freezing on its other, its poor absorption of heat and constant rotation disallowing it to ever reach an equilibrium on opposing sides, it ranges from 47° directly under the sun to a freezing -141° celsius in the coordinates opposite to the subsolar point. In that huge gradient lies a band gentle to life, though its constant march does not allow it to start, rather, lfe begun at one of the polar geysers and hot lakes connected to massive subterrenean reservoirs, that of which power pretty much all rain and snowfall.
	2. Describe creatures' organs and biochemistry in low detail and Make the oldest common ancestors of fauna and of flora:
		Reproductive cells (- and +) are formed and mixed in an individual to make a zygote that can begin growing to be a genetic clone of the parent, called an uno, or two zygotes could merge and grow into conjoined clones of their respective parents, called a dos. When the merging happens, the analogue of hox genes changes in ways to form features that are not present in unos. Though at the end of the day, uno y un son dos.
A dos' two sets of gonads has each connecting to the other side, thus mixing the genes of the two conjoined individuals into the new zygote.
	All life split to three known kingdoms coming from their respective common ancestors:
		•Duramacie (Kingdom Durimici): Creatures that make use of 6 paddles for movement, known for their possession of hard subcutaneous plates that keep them together along with six limbs and two pairs of horns, a pair big and the other small. The horns themselves are their method of oxyginating blood as they intake air through openings on the horns and run it through layers upon layers of thin membranes behind the horns, absorbing oxygen in what looks almost like sails. they also see through many small scallop-like eyes. Furthermore they're padded with deposits of fat-like cells, though it's not nearly as dense with its latticelike arrangements. They also posses duo-segmented stomachs used for buoyancy.
		•Aquacaedentes (Kingdom Minimarerum): Blind, deaf, filter feeders with four paddle like legs and many whiskers, they speed frantically filtering water with great efficiency. So great in fact they often perish from positive buoyancy of their fat little bodies getting a tad too fat. They're held together by one big plate and breath via their skin, though the aforementioned limits their size greatly.
		•Kingdom Sessilia: Photosynthesizing sessile organisms, taking advantage of the intense sun rays whilst combating the intense heat, drought, extreme cold, and predators. The common ancestor is unknown, but it's suggested a many clades came out of the water independatly. Their leaves range from a wilting earth plant's yellow to a darker fainter yellow.
		The first fauna to come on land are speculated to be a minimarerum species, followed by duramacitic omnivores, though the minimarerum had a huge headstart.
		•Kingdom Sessilia: Photosynthesizing (though not always) sessile (who woulda guessed) organisms, taking advantage of the intense sunrays whilst combating the intense heat, drought, extreme cold, and herbivores. The common ancestor is unknown, but it's there somewhere.
The first fauna to come on land are speculated to be a minimarerum species, followed by duramacitic omnivores, though the minimarerum had a huge headstart as duramacie were waiting for oxygen levels to increase.
	2. Diversify the proto ecosystem of mobile creatures:
		Skip a few dingusillion years and you'll find many descendant species, such as:
			•Watervines: Hot desert dwelling largely subterranean sessilins with above ground shrubbery, possessing hard shelled fruits that use pressure built from the heated water inside to shotgun seeds impressive distances.
			•Hermit trees: tree like organisms which only grow when a certain range of temperatures pass through, otherwise, it regresses into its insulating bark and goes into a period of dormancy until the next solar day.
			•Camelcroc: An omnivorous duramici living in the hot desert possessing a two chambered stomach, the first bigger chamber that's in its hump is solely for storage and fermentation of food for later use, be it to feed the individual or to share, meanwhile the second chamber is for digestion of the second chamber's content.
			♦Bipedal minimarerum: A herbivorous clade of minirarerum posessing a powerful pair of legs, they are the start of a clade by the name of boingerettes.
			♦Uva: A member of a new clade of minimarerum named uvaforme that link together to form a moving superorganism, they gnaw at the roots of watervines and share sustenance by circulating blood amongst eachother via two way ports on their paddles. They may seem to be disorderly, but that's not the case, as the manner in which they link separates the holobionts into two distinct sections: The outer, moving layer of uvas, while the inner layer contains unos that only come out to munch roots with great efficiency.
			•Winter Uva: Egregiously fluffy subspecies of Uva that live in the cold desert regions and feast upon hermit tree bark.
		It would seem some trends of behaviours and traits arise, some being:
			•Most sessilin seeds evolved to be small and hardy, and they exist plentifully mixed in with the sand, this creates a niche yet to be filled; seed eating herbivorous grazers.
		Another snapshot of the planet's species would show further forks in species and more niches being filled, species that arose include:
			•Camelskink
	3. Describe the beginnings of the caravan
	4. Describe the mass convergent traits and behaviour plus the extreme specializations of some species
