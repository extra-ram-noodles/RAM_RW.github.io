The roadmap:
	1. Describe the planet:
		It is a planet whose surface is entirely covered in sand, and the only open bodies of water are located at the poles, huge lakes and collections of hot springs bursting with both geothermal activity and life, in comparison the deserts were barren before the race to land which would be a challenge with the uneven diffusion of heat caused by the planet’s slow rotation, while the subsolar point sits constantly at the high forty degrees celsius, the unlit portion sits well below -40°C.
	2. Describe creatures' organs and biochemistry in low detail and Make the oldest common ancestors of fauna and of flora:
		Reproductive cells (- and +) are formed and mixed in an individual to make a zygote that can begin growing to be a genetic clone of the parent, called an uno, or two zygotes could merge and grow into conjoined clones of their respective parents, called a dos. When the merging happens, the analogue of hox genes changes in ways to form features that are not present in unos. Though at the end of the day, uno y uno son dos.
A dos' two sets of gonads has each connecting to the other side, thus mixing the genes of the two conjoined individuals into the new zygote.
	All life split to three known phylums coming from their respective common ancestors:
		•Duramacie (Phylum Durimici): A species that makes use of 6 paddles for movement, known for its possession of hard subcutaneous plates that keep it together along with six limbs and two pairs of horns, a pair big and the other small. The horns themselves are its method of oxygenating blood as it intakes air through openings on the horns and runs it through layers upon layers of thin membranes behind the horns, absorbing oxygen in what looks almost like sails. It also sees through many small scallop-like eyes. Furthermore its dermis is padded with deposits of fat-like cells, though it's not nearly as dense with its latticelike arrangements. It also possesses a two chamber stomachs, the first of which is used to hold air for buoyancy while the second is dedicated for digestion. It makes use of large amounts of water in its digestion to leech the largest amount of nutrition from its food, this became a problem as it moved to land, and its compromise was to stop any flow of food past the second chamber of the stomach until a water source is found.
		•Aquacaedentes (Phylum Minimarerum): Blind, deaf, filter feeders with four paddle like legs and many whiskers, they speed frantically filtering water with great efficiency. So great in fact they often perish from positive buoyancy of their fat little bodies getting a tad too fat. They're held together by one big plate and breath via their skin, though the aforementioned limits their size greatly.
		•Phylum Sessilia: Photosynthesizing sessile organisms, taking advantage of the intense sun rays whilst combating the intense heat, drought, extreme cold, and predators. The common ancestor is unknown, but it's suggested a many clades came out of the water independatly. Their leaves range from a weak green to a watery yellow.
		The first fauna to come on land are speculated to be a minimarerum species, followed by duramacitic omnivores, though the minimarerum had a huge headstart.
		•phylum Sessilia: Photosynthesizing (though not always) sessile (who woulda guessed) organisms, taking advantage of the intense sunrays whilst combating the intense heat, drought, extreme cold, and herbivores. The common ancestor is unknown, but it's there somewhere.
The first fauna to come on land are speculated to be a minimarerum species, followed by duramacitic omnivores, though the minimarerum had a huge headstart as duramacie were waiting for oxygen levels to increase.
	2. Diversify the proto ecosystem of mobile creatures:
		Skip a few dingusillion years and you'll find a few descendant species, such as:
			•Watervines: Largely subterranean sessilins with above ground shrubbery, possessing hard shelled seeds that are ignored by all herbivores. They’re active in the heat and dormant in the cold
			•Hermit trees: tree like organisms which only grow when a certain range of temperatures pass through, otherwise, it regresses into its insulating bark and goes into a period of dormancy until the next solar day.
			•: An omnivorous duramici species living in the heat possessing a two chambered stomach, the first bigger chamber is solely for storage of food for later use, be it to feed the individual or to share, meanwhile the second chamber is for partial digestion of the second chamber's content only to withhold it until sufficient water is found.
			♦Bipedal minimarerum: A herbivorous clade of minirarerum posessing a powerful pair of legs, they are the start of a clade by the name of .
			♦Uva: A member of a new clade of minimarerum named uvaforme that link together to form a moving superorganism, they gnaw at the roots of watervines and share sustenance by circulating blood amongst eachother via two way ports on their paddles. They may seem to be disorderly, but that's not the case, as the manner in which they link separates the holobionts into two distinct sections: The outer, moving layer of uvas, while the inner layer contains unos that only come out to munch roots with great efficiency.
			•Winter Uva: Egregiously fluffy subspecies of Uva that live in the cold desert regions and feast upon hermit tree bark.
		It would seem some trends of behaviours and traits arise, some being:
			•Most sessilin seeds evolved to be small and hardy, and they exist plentifully mixed in with the sand, this creates a niche yet to be filled; seed eating herbivorous grazers. Sessilin seeds seem to have also taken a habit of growing on corpses, outcompeting any single celled competitor, to the point the only single celled organisms around are in symbiosis with other organisms, or in the primordial geysers in the north pole
		Another snapshot of the planet's species would show further forks in species and more niches being filled, species that arose include:
			•Camelskink: A descendant of
