The roadmap:
	1. Describe the planet:
		It is a planet of sand, scorching on its subsolar side and freezing on its other, its poor absorbtion of heat disallowing it to ever reach an equilibrium on opposing sides, it ranges from 47° directly under the sun to a freezing -141° celsius in the coordinates farthest from the subsolar point. In that huge gradient lies a small band hospitable to life, though its constant march does not allow life to start, rather, it begun at one of the polar gyesers and hot lakes connected to massive subterrenean reservoirs, that of which power all rain and snowfall.
	2. Describe creatures' organs and biochemistery in low detail and Make the oldest common ancestors of fauna and of flora:
	
	All life split to a few kingdoms coming from their respective common ancestors:
		•Duramacie (Kingdom Durimici): Creatures with 5 digits spread evenly on the fore half of their flat limbs, known for their possession of hard subcutaneous plates that keep them together along with six limbs and two pairs of horns, a pair big and the other small. The horns themselves are their method of oxyginating blood as they intake air through openings on the horns and run it through layers upon layers of thin membranes behind the horns, absorbing oxygen in what looks almost like sails. they also see through many small scallop-like eyes. Furthermore they're padded with deposits of fat-like cells, though it's not nearly as dense with its latticelike arrangements, and thus it was named lesser fat. They also posses duo-segmented stomachs which were originally used for buoyancy.
		•Aquacaedentes (Kingdom Minimarerum): Blind, deaf, filter feeders with four paddle like legs and many whiskers, they speed frantically filtering water with great efficiency. So great in fact they often perish from positive buoyancy of their fat little bodies getting a tad too fat. They're held together by one big plate and breath via their skin, though the aforementioned limits their size greatly.
		•Sessilia (Kingdom Sessilin): Most creatures that don't move in adulthood are believed to come from this ancestor, this includes all shrubbery in both the hot and cold climates.
The first fauna to come on land are speculated to be a minimarerum species, followed by duramacitic omnivores, though the minimarerum had a huge headstart.
	2. Diversify the proto ecosystem of mobile creatures:
		Skip a few dingusillion years and you'll find many decendant species, such as:
		•Watervines: Hot desert dwelling largely subterrenean sessilins with above ground shrubbery, possesing hard shelled fruits that use pressure built from the heated water inside to propel seeds impressive distances.
		•Hermit trees: tree like organisms which only grow when a certain range of temperatures pass through, otherwise, it regresses into its insulating bark and goes into a period of dormancy until the next solar cycle.
		•Camelskink: An omnivorous duramici living in the hot desert possessing a two chambered stomach, the first bigger chamber that's in its hump is solely for storage and fermentation of food for later use, be it to feed the individual or to share, meanwhile the second chamber is for digestion of the second chamber's content.
		•Sand gator: A carnivorous duramici that hunts
		♦Eared jererum: A clade of minirarerum posessing powerful hearing allowing them to hear predators, they are the bottom of the food chain
		♦Uva: A clade of minimarerum ovoid creatures that link together to form a moving holobiont, they gnaw at the roots of  watervines and share sustanance by cirulating blood amongst eachother in sessions before sleeping via two way ports on their paddles. They may seem to be disorderly, however that is not the case, as the manner in which they link seperates the holobionts into two distinct sections: The outer, moving layer of uvas, while the inner layer containimg individuals that only come out when the holobiont is feeding. You could say, the legs and the stomach.
		•Winter Uva: Egregiously fluffly subspecies of Uva that live in the cold desert regions and feast upon hermit tree bark, each individual keeps warm in their method of movement, as an individual goes inside and outside the holobiont periodically as it moves, though some individuals are so deep in the holobiont's core they cannot move at all.
	3. Describe the beginnings of the caravan
	4. Describe the mass convergent traits and behaviour plus the extreme specializations of some species
