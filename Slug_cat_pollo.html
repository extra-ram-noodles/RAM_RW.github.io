    <h1> Slug cat pollo </h1>
     <p> Scugpollos predominately resemble slugcats as they're closely related, however they are much more short and stout, and lack the dexterous-ish hands of a scug, furthermore they posses a much rounder build, their fore (the section which stands erect) has a wide base that tapers in a mellow manner. Just like a marshmallow. <br> Unlike scugs, scugpollos are gonochoric and so are separated into males and females and not both, the difference is quite easy to tell in mature individuals, as females are much larger than males and posses a formation of fat most compareable to a fairly sized neck pillow. <br> Wild scugpollos are already quite the pudgy creatures, but after domestication for their eggs and meat, they became even more portly, however they were not subjected to the same artificial alterations as chickens (not in any large scale anyway), forking them off into wild scugpollos and domestic scugpollos that survived the collapse of the ancients, now called faux-wild scugpollos. <br> Withal some ancients remained preferring of eating wild scugpollos as they were superior in taste. And they were some of the easiest game there is, as long as you keep your distance. </p>
    <h2> Origin, Habitat and diet </h2>
     <p> They're one of the descendant species of the proto-scug [YET TO BE WRITTEN], having gone down the path of herbivory and settling down near flora in moist lands, usually of lower altitudes. <br> While they are still capable of eating meat, it's not often they do as it's simply too much of a hassle to hunt when slime mould, moss and plants are right there, although if they were to find some they would gobble it right up! </p>
    <h2> Behaviour </h2>
     <p> They're rather docile creatures, and so are preyed upon by lizards, and if such an attack occures the females shall protect their colony, as they are the larger of the two sexes and posses the stubborn nature comparable to a mule, they can ram with such power that one would forget how small they are. <br> Males however are small and can do nought to protect themselves say for feeble swats and bites. </p>
   <h2> Behaviour in groups </h2>
    <p> It's been made obvious that females are the dominant sex in this species, and as males are uncommon to come across colonies work somwhat similiar to chicken flocks, although with much less bickering over who's leader, as the leader's worthiness is judged by whether they're <i> Dead </i> or not, as it's their duty to stay at the edges of the colony and be the first to either attack or be attacked. </p>
    <h2> Procreation </h2>
     <p> Scugpollos lay eggs and breed no matter the season. Every cycle the male mates with one female picked out by physical wellbeing and the contrast of pheromones, the bigger the contrast the better as to mate with an individual not closely related biologically. </p>
    <h2> Relations with other species </h2>
     <p> [RELATIONS, MUTUAL OR NOT] </p>
