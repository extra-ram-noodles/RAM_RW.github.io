    <h4> Terminology: </h4>
   <h6> Feral: Once domesticated, now no longer. <br> Wild: Never domesticated. </h6>

   <h1> Slug cat pollo: </h1>
   <p> Scugpollos predominately resemble slugcats as they're closely related, however they are much more stout and stocky, and lack the somewhat dexterous hands of a scug, furthermore they posses a much rounder build, their fore (the section which stands erect) has a wide base that tapers in a mellow manner. Just like a marshmallow. <br> Unlike scugs, scugpollos are gonochoric and so are separated into males and females, the difference is quite easy to tell in mature individuals, as females are much larger than males and posses a formation of fat, most comparable to a fairly sized neck pillow. <br> Wild scugpollos are already quite the pudgy creatures, but after a few flocks of wild scugpollos were domesticated for their eggs and meat they became even more portly, however they were not subjected to the same artificial alterations as chickens (not in any large scale anyway). <br> Withal not all ancients felt saciated by easily accessable scugpollo meat, and rather "hunt" them in a controlled environment. </p>

   <h2> Origin, Habitat and diet: </h2>
     <p> They're one of the descendant species of the proto-scug [YET TO BE WRITTEN], having gone down the path of a mostly herbivorous diet and settling down near flora in moist lands, usually of lower altitudes. <br> While they are still capable of eating meat, it's not often they do as it's simply too much of a hassle to hunt when slime mould, moss and plants are right there, although that won't be the case for long as the flora is decreasing with the increasing number of scugpollos. </p>
     <hr size="1" noshade>
   <h2> Behaviour: </h2>
     <p> They're rather docile creatures, and so are preyed upon by lizards, and if such an attack occures the females shall protect their flock, as they are the larger of the two sexes and can ram with such power unexpected from a rather small creature. <br> Males however are small and can do nought to protect themselves say for feeble swats and bites. </p>
     <h3> In groups: </h3>
       <p> Females are the dominant sex in this species, flocks work somatic similar to those of chickens, although with much less bickering over who's leader, as the leader's worthiness is judged by whether they're <i> dead </i> or not, as it's their duty to stay at the forefront of it all and be the first to either attack or be attacked. <br> the leader's duties are leading voyages to new places with food and leading the flock to a new home if food gets scarce. </p>
     <h3> Care for the young: </h3>
       <p> Scugpollos' system of care is cooperative, meaning all individuals that have no current duties must participate in raising the young. </p>

   <h2> Procreation </h2>
       <p> Scugpollos lay eggs and breed no matter the season. Every cycle each male mates with one female picked out by physical well-being and the contrast of pheromones, the bigger the contrast the better as to avoid inbreeding. </p>

   <h2> Relations with other species </h2>
     <h3> Predators: </h3>
       <p> A <i> lot </i> of creatures think of scugpollos as a source of food, including but not limited to: Lizards, vultures, coalescipedes, and dropwigs. <br> there are also another type of predators, ovivororous creatures who feed off of eggs, they are what keeps the scugpollo population in control. </p>
      <h3> Blood feeders </h3>
       <p> Noodleflies pierce into sleeping scugpollos and feed of their blood. However that isn't always the case as some bigger flocks keep watch of the snoozing pile and would attack noodleflies that try to feed on their kin. </p>
     <h3> Mutual relationships </h3>
        <p> Flocks of feral scugpollos who were let out before the ancients did their thing were certain to die if it weren't for slugcats taking them into their colonies as they were identical to wild scugpollos but plumper and possessing not a lick of self-preservation, and just like scugpollos, they made heaps of eggs, except they weren't all that protective of them. <br> Wild scugpollos' population grew as scugs stopped taking eggs from them and started taking eggs from their own.. <br> ..Cattle?..Members?.. Colony in a colony?.. Ah whatever, everyone wins for the time being! <br> As feral scugpollos were integrated into scug colonies they grew smarter, meanwhile wild scugpollos started sapping their local flora as their populations grew from the effects of feral scugpollos taking their posession as the main source of eggs for scugs. </p>
