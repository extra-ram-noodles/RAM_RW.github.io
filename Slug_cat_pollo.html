    <h1> Slug cat pollo aka Scugpollo </h1>
     <p> Scugpollos are short and stout, and largely resemble slugcats as they're closely related. <br> Feral scugpollos are already quite the fubsy creatures, however, after domistication by the ancients for their eggs and meat, they became even more abdominus, but they didn't get as modified as chickens, as the ancients learned, more chicken in every chicken makes the chicken not taste chickeny enough. <br> Even with the rather stern quality checks some ancients still preferred eating wild scugpollos, they weren't particularly hard game anyway. </p>
