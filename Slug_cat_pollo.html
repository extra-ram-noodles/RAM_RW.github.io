    <h4> Terminology: </h4>
   <h6> Jungarten: the central area of a scugpollo flock full of pups. Bodged from the two German words Junge and Garten meaning Juvenile and Garden respectively. <br> Redomesticated: Once domesticated, then let out into the wild, and then domesticated once again. <br> Wild: Never domesticated. </h6>

   <h1> Slug cat pollos: </h1>
   <p> Scugpollos predominately resemble slugcats as they're closely related, however they are stouter, stockier, and lack digits. Furthermore they posses a much rounder build, their fore (the section which stands erect) has a wide base that tapers in a mellow manner. Not dissimilar to a marshmallow. <br> Unlike scugs, scugpollos are gonochoric and so seperate into males and females, the difference is quite easy to tell in mature individuals, as females are much larger than males and posses formations alike the dewlaps of a rabbit. Meanwhile males are tiny and have a primordial pouch like formation of which they use to brood. </p>

   <h3> Domestication </h3>
   <p> Scugpollos are a good source of meat and eggs, and for that very reason they were demosticated and bred to make as much product as possible, becoming plushier and laying more eggs that of which they no longer paid mind to. </p>
     <hr size="1" noshade>
   <h2> Origin, Habitat and diet: </h2>
     <p> They're one of the descendant species of the proto-scug [YET TO BE WRITTEN], having adapted to a mainly herbivorous diet and settling down in enviorments abundant in flora. <br> While they're still capable of eating meat, it's not often they do as it's simply too much of a hassle to hunt when plants and fungi are readily available in thier native habitats, although that won't be the case for long as changes to the foodweb occur after the disappearance of the ancients. </p>
     <hr size="1" noshade>
     <h2> Behaviour: </h2>
     <p> They're rather docile creatures, and so are preyed upon by lizards, when such an attack occures the females shall protect their flock, as they are the larger of the two sexes and can ram with great power. <br> Males however are small and can do nought to protect themselves, say for feeble swats and bites. </p>
     <h3> In groups: </h3>
       <p> Flocks work somewhat similar to those of chickens, having the most feisty scugpollo be leader. it's their duty to stay at the forefront of the flock and be the first to either attack or be attacked. The leader's duties also include leading expeditions and relocating the flock if food gets scarce. </p>
     <h3> Procreation </h3>
       <p> Scugpollos lay eggs and breed regardless of season. roughly every other cycle each male mates with one female it picks out by physical well-being and the contrast of scent between the pair, the bigger the contrast the better as to avoid inbreeding. <br> Males are the ones to sit on eggs as their soft primordial pouches combined with their tinier bodies are unlikely to crush eggs. </p>

   <h2> Relations with other species </h2>
     <h3> Predators: </h3>
       <p> Lots of creatures think of scugpollos as prey, and some go for their eggs, but considering how protected eggs are in the center of the flock, not many creatures get away with it unscathed. <br> But those aren't the only threats to scugpollos. Becuase their heavy build allows them to tank noodlefly bites they've been made a source of food for them as well, while noodlefly bites end up encapacitating the unfortunate victim for a period of time, rarely does it cause lasting damage. </p>
     <h3> Mutual relationships </h3>
        <p> Domestic scugpollos were let out of their facilities and back into the wild, they were doomed to go extinct as they lacked the self preservation and organization that their wild counterparts had, however, slug cats took them in for they were curious of the weird, new, smaller scugpollos that suddenly appeared, and thus scugs sticated scugpollos. <br> Wild scugpollos' population grew as scugs stopped taking eggs from them and started taking eggs from their own population of egg makers, everyone wins for the time being! <br> As redomesticated scugpollos were integrated into scug colonies they developed higher intellegence, meanwhile their wild brethren started sapping their local flora as their populations grew because of their suddenly decreased egg mortality rate. </p>

     <h2> A cycle in the life of a scugpollo: </h2>
     <h4> Wild: </h4>
     <p> For males, they pick a duty at the start of the cycle and keep at it until the end of it, duties are either gathering flora and piling it up in the jungarten for the rest of the flock, either that or they tend to pups and lay on eggs. <br> The duties of females include the aforementioned as well as gaurding the outer area of the flock's territory, looking out for any threats. if a scugpollo is tired or hungry it switches with any other scugpollo of the same sex in the jungarten to take rest and eat. </p>
     <h4> Redomesticated: </h4>
     <p> A female redomesticated scugpollo in a slugcat colony is obligated to lay eggs, though not much else, males on the other hand have no obligations, though on rare occasions some willingly sit on slugcat eggs. Any female that fails meeting its criteria or gourmandize itself with no reasonable egg return is slaughtered and eaten, giving the hunters of the colony less work to do in a cycle. </p>
