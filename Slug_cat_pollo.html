    <h4> Terminology: </h4>
   <h6> Feral: Once domesticated, now no longer. <br> Wild: Never domesticated. <br> Jungegarten: the central area of a scugpollo flock full of pups. roughly translates from german into pup garden . </h6>

   <h1> Slug cat pollo: </h1>
   <p> Scugpollos predominately resemble slugcats as they're closely related, however they are stouter and stockier, and lack the somewhat dexterous hands of a scug, furthermore they posses a much rounder build, their fore (the section which stands erect) has a wide base that tapers in a mellow manner. Not dissimilar to a marshmallow. <br> Unlike scugs, scugpollos are gonochoric and so seperate into males and females, the difference is quite easy to tell in mature individuals, as females are much larger than males and posses formations alike the dewlaps of a rabbit. </p> 
   <h3> Domestication </h3>
   <p> Scugpollos are a good source of meat and eggs, and for that very reason they were demosticated and bred to make as much product as possible, becoming plushier and laying more eggs and becoming less protective of said eggs. </p>
     <hr size="1" noshade>
   <h2> Origin, Habitat and diet: </h2>
     <p> They're one of the descendant species of the proto-scug [YET TO BE WRITTEN], having adapted to a mainly herbivorous diet and settling down in enviorments abundant in flora. <br> While they're still capable of eating meat, it's not often as it's simply too much of a hassle to hunt when plants and fungi are readily available, although that won't be the case for long as changes to the foodweb occur after the disappearance of the ancients. </p>

   <h2> Behaviour: </h2>
     <p> They're rather docile creatures, and so are preyed upon by lizards, when such an attack occures the females shall protect their flock, as they are the larger of the two sexes and can ram with great power. <br> Males however are small and can do nought to protect themselves say for feeble swats and bites. </p>
     <h3> In groups: </h3>
       <p> Flocks work somwhat similar to those of chickens, having the most feisty scugpollo be leader. There isn't much bickering over who's leader for the leader's worthiness is judged by whether they're <i> dead </i> or not, as it's their duty to stay at the forefront of the flock and be the first to either attack or be attacked. <br> the leader's duties also include leading expeditions and relocating the flock if necessary. </p>
     <h3> Care for the young: </h3>
       <p> Scugpollos are cooperative in taking care of the young, meaning all individuals must participate in raising the young. </p>
       <hr size="1" noshade>
   <h2> Procreation </h2>
       <p> Scugpollos lay eggs and breed regardless of season. Every cycle each male mates with one female it picks out by physical well-being and the contrast of scent between the pair, the bigger the contrast the better as to avoid inbreeding. </p>

   <h2> Relations with other species </h2>
     <h3> Predators: </h3>
       <p> <i> Many </i> creatures think of scugpollos as a source of food, and not only by the type of predation most would think, as some creatures go for their eggs, but considering how protected eggs are in the center of the flock, the only creatures that get away with it are scavangers and slugcats, and the occasional crafty lantern mouse. <br> But those aren't the only threats to scugpollos. Becuase their heavy build allows them to tank noodlefly bites they've been made a source of food for them as well, while noodlefly bites end up encapacitating the unfortunate victim for a period of time, rarely does it cause lasting damage. </p>
     <h3> Mutual relationships </h3>
        <p> Domestic scugpollos were let out of their enclosures and facilities and back into the wild, they were doomed to go extinct as they lacked the self preservation and organization that their wild counterparts had, however, slug cats took them in with no real intention to aid them more than a few cycles, however they proved to be . <br> Wild scugpollos' population grew as scugs stopped taking eggs from them and started taking eggs from their own.. <br> ..Cattle?..Members?.. Colony in a colony?.. Ah whatever, everyone wins for the time being! <br> As feral scugpollos were integrated into scug colonies they grew smarter, meanwhile wild scugpollos started sapping their local flora as their populations grew from the effects of feral scugpollos taking their posession as the main source of eggs for scugs. </p>

     <h2> A cycle in the life of a scugpollo: </h2>
     <h4> Wild: </h4>
     <p> For males, they pick a duty at the start of the cycle and keep at it until the end of it, said duties are either gathering flora and piling it up in the jungegarten for the rest of the flock, <i> OR </i> tend to pups of the flock in the jungegarten. <br> The duties of females include the afformentioned as well as protection from predators and gaurding the outer edges of the flock's domain, if a scugpollo is tired or hungry it tags out with any other scugpollo of the same sex in the jungegarten and takes rest.
