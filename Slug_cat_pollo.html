  <h1> Scugpollos, chickens of the Rain World. </h1>
  <p> closely related to the slugcat, branching off from proto-slugcats.
They aren't fussy animals and make heaps of eggs, and so they ended up domesticated <br> by the ancients as a replacement for chickens and chicken eggs, which at that point were of horrible quality because of all large factories choosing quantity over quality.
They're noticeably smaller than slugcats and produce a tiny amount of slime forming a thin layer of goop, which makes sense considering the low altitude moist and mossy habitats they naturally live in.
They're not as intelligent than slugcats but they're still somewhat emotionally complex creatures and could integrate into Scug colonies well, however they wouldn't occupy any big roles as to most slugcats, they are but dim pillow shaped miniature scugs, only good in hauling large items and in sleep piles. </p>
