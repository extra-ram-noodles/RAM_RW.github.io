    <h1> Slug cat pollo </h1>
     <p> Scugpollos predominately resemble slugcats as they're closely related, however they are much more short and stout, and lack the dexterous-ish hands of a scug, furthermore they posses a much rounder build, their fore (the section which stands erect) <br> Unlike scugs, scugpollos are not hermaphroditic and so are separated into males and females, the difference is quite easy to tell in mature individuals, as females are larger than males and posses a mane-like formation of fat. <br> Wild scugpollos are already quite the pudgy creatures, and after domestication for their eggs and meat, they became even more portly, however they were not subjected to the same artificial alterations as chickens (not in any large scale anyway), as the ancients learned more chicken in every chicken makes the chicken not taste chicken-y enough. <br> Withal some ancients preferred eating wild scugpollos as they were superior in taste. And they weren't particularly hard game at any rate. </p>
    <h2> Origin, Habitat and diet </h2>
     <p> They're one of the descendant species of the proto-scug [YET TO BE WRITTEN], having gone down the path of herbivory and settling down near flora in moist lands, usually of lower altitudes. <br> (<i>nederland 2?</i>) <br> While they are still capable of eating meat, it's not often they do as it's simply too much of a hassle to hunt when slime mould, moss and plants are right there, although if they were to find some they would gobble it right up! </p>
    <h2> Behaviour </h2>
     <p> They're rather inactive creatures, and so are preyed upon by all lizards, and if such an attack props up the females will protect their colony, as they pack quite the punch and will hold their ground [SOME NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS IF THERE BE] </p>
    <h2> Procreation </h2>
