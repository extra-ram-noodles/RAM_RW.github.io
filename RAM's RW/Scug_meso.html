    <h1> Slugcats </h1>
     <p> Slugcats (or scugs as they're commonly called) are long, fuzzy, bipedal, largely cylinderical creatures standing with half of their body erect and their flat faces pointing ahead with their ears shaped like a candle's flame. Furthermore, the hind of their body lays flat when in a standing postion, and is of noticeably more rotund form. Several glands dot each side of their hind end, accompanied by smaller glands sprinkled along in nonrandom formations that differ from one scug to another. <br> They were domisticated with the purpose of pipe cleaning, as their bodyplan and fur proved highly effective, even moreso after they selectively bred them to change their diameter as to fit snugly in the pipes they're assigned to. </p>

     <h2> Origin </h2>
     <p> They're descendants of the <a href="./Scug_proto.html"> proto-scug </a>, highly adaptable to any enviorment and smarter than other slug cat species, making good use of their opposable digits. </p>
     <h2> Habitat and diet </h2>
     <p> They are omnivorous in nature and so eat off of all available sources, hunting and gathering and even swiping eggs off of very suspecting wild scugpollo flocks. </p>

     <h1> Behaviour </h1>
     <p> Slugcats are a very intellegent species that take advantage of available resources. They're also complex socially and behave in neatly organized communities known as colonies, though some strains have been shown to prefer living solitarily or in groups directly related by blood. </p>
     <h3> Colony structure </h3>
     <p> In colonies, individuals are seperated into three main roles: Gaffers, henlikes, and colony proles. They can switch roles at a cycle's notice, though the physiological shifts differentiating henlikes specifically don't happen straight away. </p>
     <ul>
      <li> Gaffers take care of keeping the colony's domain safe, redividing labor if short on scugs, and relocating their colony if needed, they also manage food and hunting trips, this role is taken up by multiple. </li>
      <li> Henlikes are responsible for making eggs and raising pups, they're fierce in keeping the kindergarten safe. Though they're also fierce in appetite as conceiving pups and nursing them is energy draining. Their tell-tale sign is their ample tails with pronounced slime glands that produce a special sort of slime known as vittle that pups feed on, it's also stored externally in storage as a cooking ingredient. </li>
      <li> Colony proles do the most varied work in the entire colony, their duties include protecting the colony, hunting and preparing food for the colony, tending to others' wounds amongst other duties. </li>
     </ul>
     <h2> Procreation </h2>
     <p> Slugcats breed every season, any henlike scug may breed with a prole if feeling broody, otherwise it skips the season and makes unfertilized eggs, which are eaten as if scugpollo eggs. Proles sometimes bicker over henlikes who might not love them back, but henlikes only show their disinterest after the fact as the petty infighting between proles is an amusing sight for all. </p>
