      <h1> Protoscugs </h1>
      <p> Protoscugs are the first myxiniformes to walk on land, they emerged before the ancients' recorded history. They lean the most to the cyldrical shape and have four very apparent barbles, the biggest most upper pair of which evolved ultra sensitive to sense vibrations through the air, otherwise known as sound.  </p>

      <h2> Habitat and diet </h2>
      <p> Protoscugs stay near the waters they spawn in, as they need to stay moist, a job they can't do with their slime as their glands are too abrupt in its release to be anything but suffocation. They're scavangers, relying on their keen sense of smell (that remains powerful even with the limitations of airborne particles) to find fresh remains and small prey. </p>

      <h1> Behaviour </h1>
      <h2> Procreation </h2>
      <p> They breed every season, and newborn larvae stay in water, and have been seen grooming the slime off of their parents as a sort of nourishment. </p>
